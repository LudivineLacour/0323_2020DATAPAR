This is a file about me

# Who am I

* I was born near Saint-Etienne in France
* I'm becoming a great Data Analyst
* I used to work at comet as a Data Analyst which is my first experience as a DA

# Why am I here

* I left my company and thought I didn' have all required skills to find a new job as Data Analyst 
* I expect to learn programming skills in Python and get a more stats-oriented mindset

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* I'd love to join companies such as Blablacar and Doctolib
* I hope I can find a role with both programming and analysis tasks
* For now I'd like to become a confirmed Data Analyst and take then take a Lead position.
